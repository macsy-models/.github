## MacSy Models

Is an umbrella organization to centralize, organize, share models for [MacSyFinder](https://github.com/gem-pasteur/macsyfinder).
The models in macsy-models can be easily managed using the macsydata tool (shipped with macsyfinder).

If you are a macsyfinder modeler, you are encouraged to share your models through macsy-models (see [Contribution guidelines](../CONTRIBUTING.md)). This will ensure an easy and broad distribution of your models for MacSyFinder! 

For more details on how to create a package of data models for MacSyFinder, see [macsyfinder documentation](https://macsyfinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modeler_guide/index.html)

If you already have a package that you want to share with the MacSyFinder community, ask for a new macsy-model repository by [openning a new issue](https://github.com/macsy-models/.github/issues/new?assignees=bneron%2C+saphia&labels=ask+for+new+repository&template=ask-for-new-repos.md&title=%5BNew+Repos%5D).
